# Move funds to L2

This tutorial will help you to bridge your token from Ethereum Mainnet to Polygon \(Matic\) through the [Matic bridge](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/). Upon using the bridge you will be airdropped a few Matic tokens for your operations on the layer 2.

> _Do **not** transfer WETH directly to Matic using the bridge. To get WETH on Matic, transfer ETH!_
