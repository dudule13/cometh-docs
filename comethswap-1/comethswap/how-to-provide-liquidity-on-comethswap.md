# How to provide liquidity and Farm on ComethSwap ⚗️

1. Go on [ComethSwap](http://swap.cometh.io/) to add liquidity in your favorite pool. You need to add the same amount of each token \(you can swap before to adjust it if needed, don’t worry $50 fees are over, a swap cost you almost nothing on Polygon 😊\)

2. After approving tokens, you just need to supply liquidity to receive your “Liquidity providing tokens”
